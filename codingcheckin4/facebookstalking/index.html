<h1> How To: Facebook Stalking </h1>
<p> Facebook Stalking, commonly known as "creeping" has become a time honored tradition with preteens, teens, and young adults alike. It can be used to gather information before a first date, to come up with things you have in common before a small talk session, or can simply serve to emberass your friends when they have it coming. However, there are tactics and strategies you can use to be as thorough and effective as possible. </p>

<p><b>1. Selecting your target</b></p>
  <p> Narrow down your targets by scrolling through your news feed and seeing what jogs your interest, thinking of people whose names you learned today in class, or exes you haven't thought about in a while. Once you have decided on a person, type their name in the white search bar at the top of the page. Your search will be the most efficient if you both are already friends on Facebook. </p>

<p><b>2. The Timeline </p></b>
<p> Your search's timeline will appear after you search their name. This is where you will find out everything you need to know: old status, hometown, relationship status, old pictures, etc. While this does not provide explicit details about a person, it provides the oppurtunity to find emberassing statuses and posts from years ago. This will take some persistance, as you have to manually scroll down the page. <p>

<p><b>3. The Basics</b></p>
<p> To begin, click the "About" button directly next to their profile picture. </p>

  <p> Here, you will find the basics of your target's education, hometown, and relationship status. This is a great way to get information about your target's history. To view more information, click on the tabs on the left hand side of this page. Each page will appear like this original one, just providing different information. </p>

<p><b>4.The Pictures</b></p>
<p>Photographic evidence is often the most effective way to understand your target's past; after all, a picture says a thousand words. To locate your target's pictures, select the "Photos" button on the menu bar on their timeline. You can either look through photos they have been tagged in, photos they have individually added, or albums they have uploaded. </p>

<p>Often, it is the most effective to go through their tagged photos; this provides a more whole version of your target, and allows you to see what they're interested in, what they like to do and who their friends are.</p>

<p>This is especially effective if you scroll back multiple years, especially back to middle school; you learn a lot about someone when you see their preteen years. Similar to scrolling through someone's timeline posts, this while take some time as you must manually scroll therough their profile.</p>

  <p><b>5. Letting the world know</p></b>
  <p>Often, the primary reason for facebook stalking is to publicly emberassing your target. In order to do this, you have to let all of your mutual friends know the emberassing past photos/statuses. Below each picture/photo, you'll  see a bar featuring people's comments and "likes." Either comment or like the photo to alert your friends of what you have found, allowing them to join in on the stalking. </p>
